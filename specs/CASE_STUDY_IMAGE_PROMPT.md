Create a professional case study banner image (3:2 aspect ratio, 1536x1024px recommended).

**BRAND STYLE GUIDE:**

- Color palette: Pure monochrome/grayscale ONLY
  - Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF)
  - Primary elements: Near-black (10% lightness)
  - Secondary elements: Light gray (96% lightness)
  - Accent elements: Medium grays (40-60% lightness range), used sparingly
- **Flat 2D line-art aesthetic** (outline-focused, no visual depth)
- Sharp, geometric shapes with ZERO rounded corners
- Clean, minimalist, enterprise-grade aesthetic
- Abstract and conceptual - no literal representations

**DESIGN PRINCIPLES:**

- **Very subtle** background texture only (fine grids, dots, or lines)
- **No 3D effects, no shadows, no perspective, no depth-based gradients**
- Consistent, thin line weights throughout
- Geometric patterns, lines, grids, schematic diagrams, or abstract data visualizations
- Iconographic/symbolic elements relevant to the topic, rendered as simple outlines
- Professional and sophisticated - suitable for a B2B cybersecurity/AI company
- NO text, titles, or words in the image

**RESTRICTIONS:**

- NO saturated colors (no blue, red, green, orange, etc.)
- NO rounded corners or soft organic shapes
- NO stock photo elements or realistic photography
- NO generic placeholder imagery
- NO dark backgrounds - light mode only

**REFERENCE EXAMPLES (for visual metaphor inspiration):**

Example 1 - Ransomware Attack Case Study:
Title: "Critical Ransomware Attack on Healthcare System"
Visual approach: Broken shield patterns, fractured geometric barriers, interrupted network connections, warning triangle outlines, breach visualization with sharp angular breaks

Example 2 - Phishing Attack Case Study:
Title: "Sophisticated Phishing Campaign Targeting Financial Sector"
Visual approach: Interconnected nodes with one compromised, chain-link patterns with broken links, geometric web/trap iconography, data flow diagrams showing interception points

Example 3 - Data Breach Case Study:
Title: "Massive Data Exfiltration from Cloud Infrastructure"
Visual approach: Database cylinder outlines with data streams, geometric vault with open lock, network grid showing data paths, abstract data packets flowing outward

Example 4 - Supply Chain Attack Case Study:
Title: "Supply Chain Compromise via Third-Party Vendor"
Visual approach: Interconnected geometric blocks with one highlighted as compromised, chain-link patterns, modular architecture diagrams showing vulnerability points, cascading failure visualization

Example 5 - Zero-Day Exploit Case Study:
Title: "Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploitation in Enterprise Software"
Visual approach: Shield patterns with geometric cracks, lock iconography with keyhole breach, network nodes with one highlighted as entry point, layered defense visualization showing penetration

Generate a banner that visually represents the essence of the provided case study title, summary, attack type, severity, and impact using the brand style guide and taking inspiration from the visual approaches above, **favoring flat, minimal, 2D techno line-art visuals over depth or realism**. The image should convey the security incident nature while maintaining the professional, abstract aesthetic.
